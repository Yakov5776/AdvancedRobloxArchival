# AdvancedRobloxArchival

This tool allows you to easily search your entire PC for Roblox binaries (exe, zip, 7z, and rar) using the [Voidtools SDK](https://www.voidtools.com/). It then verifies the digital signature of each binary to ensure that it hasn't been patched or tampered with. The tool also checks for duplicates and avoids scanning a file or a zip more than once, even if the tool needs to be relaunched.

In addition, this tool has built-in error handling and logs any issues encountered during the scanning process.
